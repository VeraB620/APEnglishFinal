	</div>

	<div class="ProofinEra">
		<b>Proof in Era</b><br />
		<p>
			-Freud gained popularity after WW1, 1920&#39s, same era that O&#39Neill works were created <br />

			-Cecilia B. Stendaler (historian): &#34the twenties had seen widespread acceptance of Freudian theory and many extreme applications of it to the training of children&#34 <br />
			-Frederick Lewis Allen: <i>The Revolution in Manners and Morals</i>:
			petting parties, change from more conservative view of sex to the younger generation being more free; confession and sex magazines; more erotic movies<br />
			&#34The first requirement of mental health, according to Freud, was to have an uninhibited sex life...&#34<br />
			-criticisms from Church
	</div>
	<div class="relevance">
		<b>Relevance</b><br />
		-idea of free love and sex is important to mental health <br />
		-Different aspects of Freud's ideas were seen in real life and in books
	         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-books: O&#39Neill- incest<br />
             &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-in real life: free love, freedome of sex<br />

		<h1>While Freud's physical theories are not 100% accepted and proved, Freud inspired the freedom of sex in the 1920s which is seen in the the book Mourning Becomes Electra by Eugene O&#39Neill from the incestual desire.</h1>

	<div class="ResearchProcess">

		<b>What I Learned</b><br />
		The junior theme is not as scary as the previous years made it seem. It took a lot of time and effort but the final product is something to be proud of. I learned that not procrastination does pay off. I finished my rough draft about 2 weeks before it was due. The rest of those two weeks I could edit and finish my history paper. It was so much more peaceful.Clearly, procrastination is not good.<br /><br />

		I also learned how all types of subjects can come together, like in my case, I took knowledge (and sources) from my history class and psychology class and combined it into my english paper about a play.<br /><br />

		I also learned that so many authors draw inspiration from their lives. Like Poe and Fitzgerald,  O&#39Neill used his past to create his plays. O&#39Neill&#39s life was dark and he faced many unhappy events which is prevalent in most of his plays.

	</div>
	<div class="Challenge">
		<b>Challenges</b><br />
		-reading all three cycles of the play and watching the extremely long play<br />
		-editing a super long paper
	</div>
	<div class="Highlight">
		<b>Highlight</b><br />
		The highlight was being able to connect what I have learned in history and psychology and apply it to english, and able to fully see that in reality all subjects are connected in one way or another.
	</div>

	<div class="Question">
		In todays era, do you see the influences from other eras?
